In particular, this was for my kcd-scripts and paypal-scripts projects. Of note, Rollup, Jest, and lint-staged each received a few nice additions so I was excited to get things going!",

As a result, I pretty much can't use a mouse or keyboard; after a few minutes, I get a burning pain shooting down my arms. Even if I try to limit my computer usage to 60-second bursts, I wind up inadvertently making the situation worse.",

While I tend to be a pretty big advocate for static generation, this is a perfect use-case for server-side rendering; I can fetch and inject the database data on first render, simplifying my front-end code.",
